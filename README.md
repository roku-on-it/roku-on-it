### Hello <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5713670/87202985-820dcb80-c2b6-11ea-9f56-7ec461c497c3.gif" width="190"/> 

Just a guy looking to make my developer workflow more awesome, build performant
projects, understand memory, and ultimately craft really awesome software.

### More about me
I have a strong passion for software development and constantly strive to improve my skills and knowledge. Currently, I am focused on developing projects with Rust, TypeScript and .NET, and I am always interested in exploring new technologies and tools that can help me build better software.

In addition to those, I also have a keen interest in low-level programming and Cloud Technologies ( AWS particularly :> ). Understanding of Cloud Computing is crucial to building performant and scalable web applications IMO.

### Current interests of mine

LeetCode - *learning sorting and BST algorithms that I'll never use in my actual job(!) Joke, I actually enjoy solving interesting problems*
